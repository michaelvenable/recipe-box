  "ingredients": [
    "2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour",
    "2 tsp sugar",
    "1 1/2 tsp instant or rapid-rise yeast",
    "1 tsp salt",
    "3/4 cup plus 2 tbsp cold water",
    "2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil",
    "Cornmeal"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Process flour, sugar, yeast, and salt in a food processor until combined, about 3 seconds.",
    "With processor running, slowly add cold water and oil and process until dough forms a sticky ball that clears the sides of bowl, 30 to 60 seconds.",
    "Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled counter and knead until smooth, about 1 minute.",
    "Shape dough into a tight ball and place in a greased bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let dough rise at room temperature until almost doubled in size, 2 to 2 1/2 hours.",
    "One hour before baking, adjust oven rack to lowest position, set baking stone on rack, and heat oven to 500 degrees.",
    "Transfer dough to a lightly floured counter, divide in half, and gently shape each half into a ball. Return 1 dough ball to the bowl and cover with plastic.",
    "Coat the remaining dough ball lightly with flour and gently flatten into an 8\" disk using your fingertips. Using a rolling pin, roll dough into a 12\" circle, dusting lightly with flour as needed. (If dough springs back during rollling, let rest for 10 minutes before rolling again.",
    "Sprinkle pizza peel with cornmeal. Transfer dough to prepared pizza peel and carefully stretch to return to 12\" circle.",
    "Add pizza sauce and toppings.",
    "Slide pizza onto baking stone and bake until cheese is well browned and edges of pizza are crisp and dark, 10 to 14 minutes."
