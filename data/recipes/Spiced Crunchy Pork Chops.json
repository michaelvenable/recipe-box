        "3/4 cup all-purpose flour",
        "3 large eggs",
        "1 cup panko bread crumbs",
        "1 tbsp kosher salt",
        "1 tbsp pepper",
        "1 tbsp ground coriander",

    ],
    "directions": [
        "Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet and line half of rack with triple layer of paper towels. Pat chops dry with separate paper towels.",
        "Place flour in shallow dish. Lightly beat eggs in second shallow dish. Combine panko, salt, pepper, coriander, mustard, cayenne in third shallow dish.",
        "Working with 1 chop at a time, dredge chops in flour, shaking off excess; dip in eggs, allowing excess to drip off; then coat with panko mixture, pressing gently to adhere. Transfer chops to large plate.",
        "Heat oil in 12\" nonstick skillet over medium-high heat to 350 degrees. Add 2 chops and cook until golden brown on first side, 2 to 3 minutes. (Adjust burner, if necessary, to maintain oil temperature between 325 and 350 degrees.) Using 2 spatulas, gently flip chops; continue to cook until golden brown on second side and meat registers 140 degrees, 2 to 3 minutes longer.",
        "Transfer chops to paper towel-lined side of prepared wire rack and let drain for 15 seconds on each side, then move to unlined side of rack. Return oil to 350 degrees and repeat with remaining 2 chops. Serve with lemon wedges."
